### Concept

While it is widely believed that the philosophy behind veganism is to prevent killing of animals by not consuming meat and other animal by-products, a lot of individuals may also choose to take up a vegan diet simply because it is a healthier, more lighter option. However, somebody who is just starting out with vegan diet can be oblivious to the different aspects of being vegan - Is vegan food always this expensive, or are there cheaper options? How do I cook good vegan food? How do I plan a vegan diet that gives my body all the nutrients that it needs?

In this spirit, Simple Vegan is a platform that is aimed towards facilitating the transition to veganism for people who are just starting out. It achieves this by providing the following:

* Interested individuals can register to the platform.
* A dynamic Events page that allow registered members to browse for events (Vegan related workshops, cooking demonstrations, game-nights etc.) and RSVP to events they want to attend. The page also manages time conflicts between multiple events.
* A blog where registered members can write about their vegan experiences, tips, reviews and recommendations. The blog also features a real-time comments section.
